2. How to use

## What it does
The webslides webapp is a simple web application. On this site, you can upload a .pptx file that you want to convert to Open Webslides. After the conversion, the Open Webslides will be returned in a downloadable zip file.

(Currently, it does not return any converted files yet. This will be implemented in a later version.)

## How to use
Files can be selected in two ways.
* Select your files using the choose button
* Drag your selected files in the indicated area

The selected files must be of type .pptx. Files with other extensions will not get accepted.
After selecting the files you want to convert, click the convert button to get the .pptx files as Open Webslides.
